# to-do-list-app


This app is made with html, css and Jquery.

Using the Jquery  I made basic funvtions for to do list.
The user can add a new item to a list of items.
The user can cross out an item from the list of items.
The user can delete an item from the list of items.
The user can change the order of items in the list of items.


By opening the script.js file, the written comments help the viewer understand which pieces of code aplly to each functionality.

The classes necessary to create the functions are created in the js file, in order to cross with the elements already included in the html.
